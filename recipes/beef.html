    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>

        but made in a skillet. Itâ€™s nicely saucy, with a family-friendly mild heat.</p>
    <p>This paragraph is also a discription. Sentence two! Sentence three?</p>

            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper, chopped</li>
            <li>1 cup long grain white rice</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups lower-sodium beef broth</li>
            <li>1 (4 ounce can) diced green chiles</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon chopped green onion or cilantro</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Cook ground beef, onion, red bell pepper, and garlic in an extra-large
                 tall-sided skillet over medium heat until beef is no longer pink and 
                 vegetables are tender, stirring occasionally to break up large chunks
                  of ground beef, about 8 minutes; drain fat.</li>
            <li>Stir in rice, salt, and cumin. Cook and stir for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Stir in tomato paste. Cook and stir for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Mix in undrained diced tomatoes, broth, diced chiles, and 
                Worcestershire sauce. Bring to boiling. Reduce heat, cover, and 
                simmer until liquid is reduced and rice is tender, about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove skillet from heat. Sprinkle with cheese. 
                Cover and let stand until cheese melts, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Garnish with green onion.</li>       
        </ol>
