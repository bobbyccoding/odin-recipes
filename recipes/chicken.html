    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
    <p>This baked sweet and sour chicken made with chicken thighs and pineapple is a "dump" version of one of the most popular dishes in a Chinese restaurant. 
        Skip the deep frying and bake everything together in one dish to create a lighter twist on a classic with no sacrifice of flavor.</p>
        <p>This paragraph is also a discription. Sentence two! Sentence three?</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Cornstarch</li>
            <li>1/3 green bell pepper, cut into bite-sized chunks</li>
            <li>1/3 red bell pepper, cut into bite-sized chunks</li>
            <li>1/3 cup bite-sized pineapple chunks</li>
            <li>1/3 cup ketchup</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons seasoned rice vinegar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 large clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ginger paste</li>
            <li>1 green onion, sliced, or as needed (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). 
                Lightly grease a baking dish or spray with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Pat chicken thighs dry with a paper towel, cut into 1-inch chunks, and add to the dish. 
                Sprinkle with cornstarch, and toss until chicken is coated. 
                Stir in onions, green and red bell peppers, and pineapple.</li>
            <li>Add ketchup, rice vinegar, brown sugar, soy sauce, garlic, 
                    and ginger paste to a small bowl, whisk until well combined, 
                    and stir into the chicken mixture.</li>
            <li>Bake until chicken is no longer pink at the center and juices run clear,
                 14 to 17 minutes, stirring halfway through. An instant-read thermometer 
                 inserted near the center should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). 
                 If sauce is a bit thick, stir in a splash of water to thin out until 
                 you reach your desired consistency.</li>
            <li>Garnish with green onion slices and serve.</li>
        </ol>
